Before it was named, grep was a private utility written by Ken Thompson to search files. He was approached by his manager, Doug McIlroy, who expressed interest in having a similar functionality implemented. Thompson responded that he would think about such utility overnight, but what he did was actually fixing bugs and making improvements, which took about an hour. The next day Thompson presented grep to McIlroy, who said it was exactly what he wanted. Thompson's account may explain why it is believed that grep was written overnight.[6]

The first version of grep was written by Ken Thompson in PDP-11 assembly language to help Lee E. McMahon analyze the text of the Federalist Papers to determine authorship of the individual papers.[7] The ed text editor (also authored by Thompson) had regular expression support but could not be used on such a large amount of text, so Thompson excerpted that code into a standalone tool.[1] He chose the name because in ed, the command g/re/p would print all lines matching a previously defined pattern.[8][9] grep was first included in Version 4 Unix. Stating that it is "generally cited as the prototypical software tool", Doug McIlroy credited grep with "irrevocably ingraining" Thompson's tools philosophy in Unix.[10]
